The file "table_a1.txt" contains stellar structure 
model data during the Asymptotic Giant Branch phase for
the new models described in Karakas (2009, MNRAS).

Each file contains:

Header which lists the initial mass and metallicity of the model.

1) pulse number 
2) the core mass, Mcore (Msun)
3) maximum mass of the intershell convection zone, M_csh (Msun)
4) duration of intershell convection, t_csh (years)
5) mass dredged into the envelope, D_dredge (Msun)
6) lambda
7) lambda_dup defined by Goriely & Mowlavi (= lambda x (DMh/Mpulse) where
 	Mpulse is the maximum mass of the intershell convection zone, given in column 2
8) maximum temperature in the He-shell, THeshell (K)
9) maximum temperature at the base of the convective envelope during the
	previous interpulse period, Tbce (K)
10) maximum temperature in the H-shell during the previous interpulse period, THshell (K)
11) interpulse period (years) - note that the first entry is set to zero
12) the total mass, Mtot (Msun)
13) maximum radiated luminosity during the previous interpulse period, MaxL (Lsun)
14) maximum He-luminosity during a thermal pulse, MaxLHe (Lsun)
15) maximum stellar radius during the previous interpulse period (Rsun)
16) The bolometric luminosity
17) Effective temperature (Kelvin)

All units are in solar units except temperatures, which are in kelvin and
times, which are in years.

The stellar yields are provided in six seperate files:
    1) table_a2.txt
    2) table_a3.txt
    3) table_a4.txt
    4) table_a5.txt
    5) table_a6.txt

Each file contains:

Header which lists the initial mass and metallicity of the model, and
the final core mass.


1) species i
2) atomic mass of the species i
3) nett yield (Msun)
4) mass of species i lost in the wind (Msun)
5) mass of species i initially present in the wind (Msun)
6) the average abundance of species i in the wind (mass fraction)
7) initial mass fraction of species i (mass fraction)
8) production factor, f = log10( average abundance of i / initial abundance )
